                <p class="card-bio">
                  Batman, also known as Bruce Wayne, is a billionaire
                  philanthropist who turned personal tragedy into a lifelong
                  crusade against crime. After witnessing the murder of his
                  parents as a child, he trained his body and mind to become
                  Gotham City's greatest detective and protector. Unlike many
                  superheroes, Batman has no superpowers relying instead on
                  intellect, strategy, martial arts, and cutting edge
                  technology. He represents the power of human resilience and
                  determination in the face of darkness. Culturally, Batman has
                  become a symbol of justice without compromise, inspiring
                  countless narratives around trauma, morality, and vigilantism
                  across literature, film, and social commentary.

                <p class="card-bio">
                  Tony Stark, a genius inventor and CEO of Stark Industries,
                  transformed from a self centered weapons manufacturer to the
                  armored hero Iron Man after a life threatening injury forced
                  him to reconsider his legacy. By building a powered suit to
                  escape captivity, he not only saved his own life but created a
                  new path as a global protector. Stark's technological genius
                  and charm made him a founding member of the Avengers and a
                  symbol of redemption through innovation. His character
                  explores the consequences of power, corporate responsibility,
                  and personal growth. In popular culture, Iron Man has inspired
                  a fascination with advanced technology and ethics in AI, while
                  reshaping the modern superhero archetype as deeply flawed yet
                  heroic.

                  Peter Parker, a high schooler bitten by a radioactive spider,
                  gained super strength, agility, and wall crawling powers,
                  becoming the friendly neighborhood Spiderman. After Uncle
                  Ben's death, he vowed to use his powers wisely, living by the
                  mantra: "With great power comes great responsibility." While
                  battling villains, Peter also juggles school, work, and
                  relationships, making him a relatable hero. Spiderman reflects
                  the struggles of growing up, moral responsibility, and the
                  resilience of the underdog showing that anyone, no matter
                  their background, can be a hero.

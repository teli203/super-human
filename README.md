 ## Super Humans of Cinema

💥💥💥 [Super Humans of Cinema](https://super-humans.vercel.app/index.html) 💥💥💥

This project showcases a collection of professionally designed super heroe's and villains comic images. Majority of these images can be found on [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/). I recently had the chance to collaborate with an artist on designing a landing page for her artwork. She was incredibly inspiring working with her made me realize how much creativity web developers and artists actually share. Initially, she wanted to build the site herself but found the process frustrating and felt limited by website builders. She was looking for something more personal, yet flexible enough for her to update on her own whenever inspiration struck.

With her background in UI and familiarity with frontend development, we were able to work together in a really collaborative way. While this site, Super Humans of Cinema, isn’t an exact replica of what we built, it serves as a shared learning project and a starting point for both of us to grow from.

As a freelancer, it can be challenging to price projects based solely on an initial idea. I always try to walk clients through the process of building a website and explain why pricing isn’t one-size-fits-all. If you explore the repo for this site, you'll notice that in some stages, I circled back to establish base code and file structures that a typical developer would usually set up from the start. These were intentional learning moments to show her the importance of basic HTML rendering and how it impacts design, browser behavior, and deployment. 

I didn’t expect to learn as much as I did from a freelancer’s perspective especially when it came to basic pricing, service offerings, and setting long term goals for a client’s success. I'm grateful for the opportunity and learning experience from it, I can't wait to see what's next in my road to code.

I truly enjoyed building this project.. and not because I love a good super hero.. but because.. (I lied.. it's because I live for a good super hero/villain combo). After all I am the real Batman. Enjoy, and Happy Coding.

      <h1>Bio of The Creator</h1>
      <div class="bio">
        In the neon lit depths of Mahtog, a city rebuilt from the smoldering
        circuits of the old world, lived a woman whose brilliance electrified
        the skyline by day and whose shadow ruled the rooftops by night. By
        daylight, she was Ivory Knight, legendary full-stack developer and cloud
        architect at Sage Tech, the clean energy tech empire she built from
        scratch with nothing but code, courage, and a six 9's of availability.
        The world saw her as an eccentric genius hoodie wearing coder with too
        many patents and too few interviews. By day quiet cafés were her
        Batcaves. And tech was her superpower. Weaving in and out of the web
        verse creating good and destroying bad bytes. But when the sun dipped
        behind the her digital towers… She became The Shade Ivory Knight. A
        masked sentinel forged from trauma, intellect, and legacy. Years ago,
        her parents activists and brilliant data scientists were lost in a
        devastating blackout. A cyber assault launched by Wildcard, a glitching
        villain whose laugh shattered firewalls and bent reality with corrupted
        code. Raised by her grandmother, a hidden Wakandan emissary, Ivory
        trained in ancient martial arts and vibranium infused tech, learning
        secrets even a Black Panther would nod to. Like Superman, she held
        strength beyond human limits, thanks to an alien solar fusion embedded
        in her DNA left behind in a crashed vessel her parents once studied.
        From Wonder Woman, she inherited a relentless drive for justice,
        sharpening her edge during a "gap year" with the Amazons. Her brain read
        people like source code, and after a fateful lightning strike unlocked
        dormant genes from her Ivory bloodline, she could manipulate
        electromagnetic pulses disabling drones or powering entire blocks. Her
        scars from society ran deep. Mount Bane, the biotech boosted brute, once
        snapped the very servers housing Mohtag civil records erasing
        identities, crumbling medical systems, and nearly breaking her... wall
        of intrusion. She clawed her way back physically, mentally, and
        digitally. She coded and hacked her way out of the void, line by line,
        crippling the dark grid. She became a ghost in the grid. A myth in the
        firewalls. A symbol in the syntax. Now, when threats rise over Mahtog,
        she doesnt fly or shout. She descends. Cloaked in quantum woven armor,
        lined with ancient threads from Wakanda, wings folded like blackout
        curtains. Her gadgets? A grappling hook pulsing with mini EMPs Augmented
        visors laced with vibranium filters An AI sidekick built from remnants
        of Jarvis, blended with Kryptonian code To the world, she's Ivory Knight
        a kid who got lucky as a teen web developer. Conquering hackathons by
        fifteen, a digital introvert. Who earned a degree in Cloud engineering,
        her Master's in Business Networking, and a Doctorate's in Psychology.
        But in the whispers of the dark web? In the encrypted cries of
        criminals? They call her: The Real Batman. Because she knows…
        <div id="qt">
          <q>
            Justice isn't about brute strength or fame. It's about never giving
            up, no matter how broken the code is… Or what system has been
            infultrated. The world becomes what the good make it.
          </q>
        </div>

        While the villains laugh and bully their way through the world? She's
        already in their servers. Mapping everything they've touched decrypting
        their plans. 
        <p>Logging off,</p>
        <span>Ivory Knight</span>

        <h4>A Note from the Creator:</h4>
        Wild bio, right? But hey while Ivory's story is fiction (for now), this
        site was inspired by a real life project I had the joy of building for a
        brilliant artist. She wanted her work to shine without distraction just
        clean, focused design that lets creativity speak for itself. None of the
        artwork on this site belongs to me. They're beautiful pieces I pulled
        from Pinterest as placeholders. If any of them speak to you, I highly
        encourage you to explore and support the artists by making an account
        and diving into that creative universe. Until then… stay curious, stay
        coding. And maybe… stay in the shadows.
